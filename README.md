A simple command-line based shopping cart system implemented in C. This system allows users to register, login, add items to the cart, delete items from the cart, calculate the total cost, and display the items in the cart.
Key Features:
- User registration and login functionality
- Hash table implementation for efficient item management
- Ability to add and delete items from the cart
- Calculation of the total cost of items in the cart
- Display of items in a structured format
- Error handling for invalid inputs and system constraints

Technologies:
- Written in C programming language
- Uses data structures such as structs and linked lists
- Utilizes hash table for efficient item storage and retrieval

This project serves as a foundation for a basic shopping cart system and can be extended or customized according to specific requirements. It can be used as a learning resource for C programming and data structure concepts.
